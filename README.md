# What is Parchment?
Parchment is an Obsidian theme meant to emulate the feeling of working on parchment or within a manilla folder. The goal is for the theme to be minimal and light weight yet provide a warmer alternative to typical light themes.

### Please note
This is my first theme and as such the CSS is a mess and will be rewritten in due time to be consistent and easy to work with. Until then I will not submit this theme to be available via community themes
